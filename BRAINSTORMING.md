# **Shopping List App - Brainstorming Document**

## **Project Vision**
The Shopping List app is a web-based tool designed to help users find the best deals on groceries and other essentials. By comparing prices across multiple stores and allowing users to filter results by location, brand, and preferences, the app makes it easy to save money and shop smarter.

---

## **Core Features**
1. **Search for Items**
   - Users can enter a product name (e.g., "milk") and see pricing from multiple stores.
   - Include search suggestions for an improved user experience.

2. **Compare by Store or Brand**
   - Results can be sorted by store location, brand, price, or other user-defined factors.

3. **Location-Based Filtering**
   - Show results from stores near the user’s specified location.

4. **Favorites or Shopping List**
   - Allow users to save their favorite items or create a grocery list.
   - Automatically compare prices for the items in the list.

5. **Price History (Future Feature)**
   - Show price trends to help users understand when to buy.

6. **Store Brand producer**
   - Figure out a way to identify with brand name product maker produces the store brand's
   version of the product

## **Data Sources and APIs**
1. **Retailer APIs**
   - Partner with large grocery chains offering public APIs for product data and pricing.
2. **Web Scraping**
   - As a fallback, scrape data from store websites (ensure compliance with terms of service).
3. **Third-Party Grocery APIs**
   - Explore options like RapidAPI’s grocery database, Kroger API, or Instacart API for data acquisition.
4. **Caching Mechanism**
   - Use tools like Redis to cache frequently accessed data.

## **Development Plan**

### **Backend Development**
- **Tech Stack:** Choose a framework such as Node.js, Django, or Flask.
- **Database Options:** 
  - PostgreSQL or MySQL for relational data.
  - MongoDB for flexible, NoSQL storage.
- **API Design:**
  - Create internal endpoints for:
    - Fetching product prices.
    - Caching pricing data.
    - Managing user accounts and preferences.
- **Scalability:** Use cloud-native tools for scaling (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).

### **Frontend Development**
- **Framework or Library:** 
  - React, Angular, or Vue.js for an interactive user interface.
  - Use Material-UI or Tailwind CSS for consistent and polished design.
- **Features:**
  - Search bar with autocomplete.
  - Filters for sorting by price, store, and brand.
  - Comparison tables or grids for easy visualization.
- **Responsiveness:** Ensure mobile compatibility, as users may shop on the go.

### **Comparison Logic**
- **Data Normalization:**
  - Standardize product descriptions (e.g., unit sizes, weights) across retailers.
- **Sorting and Filtering:**
  - Prioritize based on user-defined factors like price or proximity.
- **Suggestions:** 
  - Recommend alternative or similar products when items are unavailable.

## **User Accounts (Optional)**
1. **Features:**
   - Save comparison lists.
   - Receive alerts when prices drop.
   - Enable personalized settings, like preferred stores or brands.
2. **Privacy and Security:**
   - Encrypt user data and comply with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR).

---

## **Development Tools**
- **Backend Frameworks:** Python (Flask/Django) or JavaScript (Node.js/Express).
- **Frontend Tools:** React with Material-UI or Tailwind CSS.
- **Database Options:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB.
- **API Handling:** Use Axios for frontend API requests and RESTful practices in backend API design.
- **Hosting Options:**
  - Start with platforms like Heroku, Netlify, or Vercel.
  - Scale with AWS Amplify, Fly.io, or other cloud services.

---

## **Testing and Iteration**
1. **Minimal Viable Product (MVP):**
   - Launch with the ability to search for a single item and compare prices from a few sources.
2. **User Feedback:**
   - Gather insights to refine features and prioritize development.
3. **A/B Testing:**
   - Experiment with different UI layouts or sorting algorithms to optimize the experience.

---

## **Advanced Features for Future Development**
1. **Historical Insights:**
   - Display trends for product prices to help users identify seasonal changes.
2. **Shopping List Optimization:**
   - Suggest the cheapest combination of items from different stores.
3. **Progressive Web App (PWA):**
   - Add offline functionality and the ability to install the app on mobile devices.

### **Next Steps**
1. Set up the project structure in the repository.
2. Define the tech stack and tools to use for both frontend and backend development.
3. Start building the MVP:
   - Search for items.
   - Display pricing from at least two stores.
4. Document key decisions and iterations to refine the app further.
